## User Stories for Mobile Feed and Post Creation


### Priority 1: Basic Post Component
This priority includes the core elements needed to display posts in a feed. It covers the basic post UI structure, engagement metrics, and fundamental interaction capabilities. These components form the essential foundation of the social feed experience.
