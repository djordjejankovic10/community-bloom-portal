/**
 * AnnouncementBanner Component
 * 
 * A dismissible banner that appears at the very top of the community feed.
 * Displays important announcements from community leaders prominently.
 * 
 * UX Notes:
 * - Users see this banner immediately when they enter the feed
 * - The banner is theme-colored to draw attention to important announcements
 * - Content is limited to 3 lines to maintain clean feed layout
 * - Users can dismiss the banner with the X button on the right
 * - Dismissal state is remembered across sessions using localStorage
 * - The banner only shows if there's an active announcement to display
