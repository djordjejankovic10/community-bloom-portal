# PRD - Mobile Community Feed and Post Creation

*Note: Enable Chrome Zoom extension for optimal image viewing*

## TL;DR

This feature introduces a comprehensive mobile-first social feed and post creation system as part of Project Rebase, which merges Kajabi's Branded Mobile App (BMA), Kajabi Member App (KMA), and Kajabi Communities App (KCA) into a single unified codebase. The new native implementation of communities will replace the current webview approach, offering significantly improved performance, enhanced user experience, and seamless integration with other Kajabi products. By implementing a modern interface with support for rich media, polls, replies, and reactions, we'll increase engagement metrics by 35%+ while simplifying the ecosystem for both members and Heroes. This strategic merger impacts over 1 million monthly active users across all three existing apps and addresses a critical customer pain point: the fragmentation between course content and community interactions.

## Narrative

Sarah, a fitness enthusiast, opens her Kajabi mobile app and immediately sees a well-organized feed of posts from her fitness community alongside her enrolled courses. She notices a pinned post from the community founder highlighting an upcoming challenge, which appears directly in her main feed rather than requiring her to switch to a separate app. While scrolling, she sees posts with images showing workout techniques, videos demonstrating exercises, and polls asking about preferred training methodsâ€”all loading quickly with native performance.

Sarah decides to share her own progress by creating a post. She taps the compose button, writes about her recent milestone, attaches before-and-after photos, and adds the hashtag #TransformationTuesday. She selects the "Weight Training" category and publishes her post. Shortly after, she receives reactions and comments from community members congratulating her. She engages with these interactions by responding to comments and reacting to others' posts, feeling connected and motivated by the supportive community experience. When she wants to reference course material related to her achievement, she can do so without switching apps, creating a seamless learning and community experience.

## Project Context

This implementation is a critical component of Project Rebase, which aims to merge three separate Kajabi apps into a unified experience:

- **Kajabi Member App**: 811k MAU
- **Kajabi Communities App**: 123k MAU 
- **Kajabi Branded App**: 98k MAU

The current fragmentation creates significant challenges:
- Inconsistent user experience across different apps
- Duplicated development effort and slower release cycles
- Increased bug reports (22% increase in Q1 2025 compared to Q4 2024)
- User confusion about which app to use for what purpose
- Multiple login requirements creating friction

By rebuilding the communities experience with native components instead of webviews, we'll address the top reported issues:
- Media playback issues (26% of bugs)
- UI/UX navigation/scrolling issues (10.2% of bugs)
- Performance and loading problems (10% of bugs)
- Account and login difficulties (8.2% of bugs)

This native implementation will serve as the foundation for both free and branded experiences, with BMA being differentiated through customization, in-app purchases, and push notification capabilities.

## Customer Problems

**Fragmented User Experience Across Multiple Apps**
Members and Heroes currently navigate between multiple apps to access courses and community content, creating significant friction and confusion. This separation leads to reduced engagement as users often abandon one experience rather than switching contexts. Heroes consistently report that having separate apps for courses and communities is their biggest pain point, with many considering competing platforms that offer unified experiences.

**Limited Engagement Options in Mobile Community Spaces**
Mobile users currently lack robust ways to interact with community content, resulting in passive consumption rather than active participation. Without intuitive reaction systems, threaded replies, and visible engagement metrics, users struggle to meaningfully connect with content and other community members, leading to lower retention and engagement metrics.

**Cumbersome Content Creation on Mobile Devices**
Creating rich, engaging content on mobile devices is often frustrating and limited compared to desktop experiences. Users struggle with attaching media, formatting text, and creating interactive content like polls, causing many to delay sharing until they can access a desktop interface. This reduces spontaneous content creation that keeps communities vibrant.

**Poor Media Consumption Experience**
Existing mobile community interfaces (especially in the webview implementation) provide suboptimal experiences for viewing different media types (images, videos, URLs). Media elements are frequently misaligned, improperly sized, or difficult to interact with on smaller screens. This frustrates users and diminishes the impact of visual content that's critical for engagement in fitness and wellness communities.

**Fragmented Discussion Threads**
Community conversations are difficult to follow without proper threading and comment organization. Replies get lost in chronological feeds, making it challenging to track discussions and deterring meaningful conversation. This is particularly problematic for questions, polls, and educational content where discussion context is crucial.

## Why Will It Be Successful?

- **Community-Course Integration:** By bringing courses and communities into a single app, we directly address the #1 pain point reported by Heroes and their members, solving a problem that competitor platforms like Circle and Skool are using against us.

- **User-Focused Design:** Our mobile-first approach addresses specific pain points identified through user feedback, with particular attention to engagement and content creation workflows optimized for touch interfaces.

- **Native Performance Gains:** Replacing webviews with native components will dramatically improve load times, responsiveness, and stability, addressing the 46%+ of reported bugs related to performance, media playback, and UI issues.

- **Engagement-Driven Architecture:** Every feature is designed specifically to increase user activity metrics - the reaction system encourages quick interactions, the improved media experience makes content more compelling, and the threading system facilitates deeper conversations.

- **Business Alignment:** While including communities in the free app might seem to reduce BMA's unique value, it actually boosts overall Hero success and long-term Kajabi revenue by providing a better experience to all 1M+ members, not just BMA users (100k MAU). When Heroes succeed in engaging their audience, they're more likely to retain and upgrade their Kajabi subscriptions.

## Risks & Dependencies

| Risk/Dependency | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| We're replacing the live Communities app entirely â€” which means once we ship, we can't roll back or run A/B tests | Extend internal testing period before production deployment. Implement feature flags to enable gradual rollout. Conduct extensive QA with real-world usage patterns. Create a comprehensive monitoring dashboard to catch issues early. |
| User transition from Communities App to unified app could cause disruption and potential member churn | Create seamless migration path with automatic authentication between apps. Implement clear in-app guidance for transitioning users. Provide Heroes with communication templates to help their members through the transition. Monitor transition metrics closely and rapidly address any friction points. |
| Apple App Store rejection risk as community features may remove reader app exemption | Implement in-app purchase options for Kajabi courses to satisfy App Store requirements. Ensure app reviewer can access community content. If needed, develop a marketplace approach for monthly content access to satisfy IAP requirements. |
| Android development capacity constraints creating feature parity risks | Prioritize core features to ensure both platforms launch with equivalent functionality. Consider temporary contractors for Android development if timeline requires. Create cross-platform components where possible to maximize code reuse. |
| Performance degradation with media-heavy feeds | Implement progressive loading, media compression, and virtualized lists. Set up performance monitoring with alerts for degradation. Conduct load testing with simulated high-volume feeds of mixed content types. |
| Media upload failures in poor connectivity | Develop robust offline support with background uploading and retry logic. Implement chunked uploads for larger files. Add clear visual indicators for upload status and temporarily store draft posts locally. |
