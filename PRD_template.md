## TL;DR
<!-- Provide a concise 2-4 sentence summary that clearly articulates:
- What the feature does
- The primary user benefit
- Business value
- Integration with existing product ecosystem
Example: "This feature introduces in-app subscriptions for mobile branded apps, enabling creators to sell recurring content access directly through iOS/Android. This expands monetization options, provides a seamless purchase experience, and helps retain customers with automatic renewals while ensuring Kajabi's revenue share." -->

This feature will... 

## Narrative
<!-- Create a compelling user story that:
- Features a realistic user persona (typically a Kajabi creator or their customer)
- Walks through a complete feature journey from discovery to value realization
- Highlights key interaction points and outcomes
- Demonstrates how the feature solves a real problem
Example: "Sarah, a fitness instructor with a Kajabi-powered mobile app, wants to offer premium workout content. She creates a monthly subscription offer in her Kajabi dashboard, configures pricing tiers, and publishes it. Her customer, Mark, discovers the subscription in her app, purchases it with a single tap using Apple Pay, and immediately gains access to exclusive content. Sarah receives notification of the new subscription and can track her recurring revenue through the Kajabi dashboard." -->

Jane, a knowledge entrepreneur, logs into her Kajabi account and...

## Customer Problems
<!-- Identify 2-4 specific customer problems with:
- Clear, concise problem statements as headers
- Brief explanation of how the problem impacts users (pain points)
- Any relevant data points or customer feedback supporting the problem
- Why solving this problem matters to the business
Example:
**Limited Monetization Options in Mobile Apps**
Kajabi Partners can only sell one-time purchases through their mobile apps, missing opportunities for recurring revenue streams that subscription models provide. This leads to lower LTV and reduced predictability in revenue forecasting. -->

## Why Will It Be Successful?
<!-- Provide concrete reasons for success including:
- Market/competitive analysis (what competitors are doing)
- User demand signals (feedback, requests, survey data)
- Business case (revenue potential, retention improvements)
- Technical/UX advantages over alternatives
- Strategic alignment with company goals/roadmap
Example:
- Strong user demand: Over 60% of surveyed partners requested subscription capabilities
- Competitive advantage: Main competitors (Thinkific, Teachable) already offer this feature
- Revenue opportunity: Subscription-based creators show 40% higher LTV than one-time purchase models
- Platform stickiness: Subscriptions create long-term relationships between creators and customers -->

- Reason 1: [Explain with specific data points or competitive analysis]
- Reason 2: [Explain with user demand signals or business case]
- Reason 3: [Explain with strategic alignment or technical advantages]

## Success Metrics
<!-- Define specific, measurable KPIs including:
- Primary metrics that directly measure success
- Secondary metrics to track potential side effects
- Baseline values where available
- Target values with timeframes
- Segmentation by user type where relevant
Example:
### Creator Metrics
- Adoption rate: 20% of eligible mobile app creators using subscriptions within 3 months
- Revenue increase: 15% increase in average revenue per mobile app
- Retention: 10% improvement in creator retention for those using subscriptions

### End-User Metrics
- Conversion rate: 5% of mobile app users convert to subscribers
- Retention: 60% 3-month subscription retention rate
- Engagement: 40% higher session frequency for subscribers vs. non-subscribers -->

### Admin Metrics
- Metric 1: [Specific KPI + baseline + target + timeframe]
- Metric 2: [Specific KPI + baseline + target + timeframe]

### Member Metrics
- Metric 1: [Specific KPI + baseline + target + timeframe]
- Metric 2: [Specific KPI + baseline + target + timeframe]

## Proposed Solution
<!-- Start with context around the overall approach, then detail specific requirements:
- Technical approach overview
- Platform constraints or considerations
- Integration with existing systems
- Key user flows
- Backend/infrastructure considerations -->

> **Context**: [Provide overview of the solution approach, technical considerations, and how it integrates with existing systems. Include any platform constraints or strategic decisions that influenced the solution design.]

### Requirements

| Priority | User Story | Description | Design |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------|
| P0 | As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit] | Include detailed acceptance criteria with:
- Specific functionality
- Edge cases and error handling
- Platform-specific considerations
- API requirements
- Validation rules
- Permission/access controls
Example: "Creator must be able to set subscription price between $0.99-$999.99 in their local currency. System must validate against App Store/Play Store pricing tiers. For introductory offers, system should support free trials (1-30 days) and intro pricing (50-85% of base price)." | [Link to specific Figma frame or screen showing this feature] |

## Phased Approach
<!-- For larger features, break implementation into logical phases:
- Clear phase names (MVP, Beta, GA, etc.)
- Timeline estimates for each phase
- Specific scope/deliverables per phase
- Entry/exit criteria between phases
- Testing approach for each phase
Example:
### Phase 1: Limited Beta (Q2 2025)
- Single subscription tier support
- iOS platform only
- Manual approval process for creators
- 10 partner accounts with existing history

### Phase 2: General Availability (Q3 2025)
- Multiple subscription tier support
- iOS and Android platforms
- Self-service capability for all eligible creators
- Automated approval process -->

### Phase 1: [Name/Date]
- Deliverable 1
- Deliverable 2

### Phase 2: [Name/Date]

## Risks & Dependencies

| Risk/Dependency | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Risk 1: [Specific technical, business, or user risk with likelihood/impact] | Detailed plan addressing how to prevent or respond to this risk. Include contingency plans and ownership. Example: "API rate limits might affect high-volume creators. We'll implement request batching and throttling controls, with monitoring alerts at 70% threshold." |
| Dependency 1: [External system, team, or decision dependency] | Plan to manage this dependency including alternative approaches and timelines. Example: "Requires App Store approval for subscription model. Will submit preliminary plan 60 days before launch and incorporate feedback from Apple review team." |
| Risk 2: [Specific technical, business, or user risk with likelihood/impact] | How we'll address this risk... |
